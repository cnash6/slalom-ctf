# Slalom CTF - Over The Wire

The goal of this CTF is simple: Get to level 26.  For this hackathon we'll be doing a challenge maintained by the OverTheWire group. First thing's first: Set up a team.

Teams are between 1 and 3 people, but this challenge is linear so scaling numbers of people won't necessarily help you.  Teams will share the same login, so make sure your password is okay to share between the team members.

This challenge progresses in levels, with the goal of each level being to find the password for the next level.  When you unlock a level, use the pasword as the "flag" on the score server to earn points.  First team to reach the last level wins. The challenges start out hard, but get a lot harder as you go along. And that's it. Happy Hacking!
